# BitcubeEval
Section 3:
Initially I created a project using ASP.Net MVC to complete Section 1 and Section 2, but now for Section 3 I've changed the project inside BitCube solution to be a Blazor Server project. 

The project does the following:

-Read hardcoded dummy data and display the data to the views.

-Can add a new Student.

-Can Link a Student to a Degree(Enroll)

-Can Remove a Student to a Degree

-Can View all Courses linked to a Degree
